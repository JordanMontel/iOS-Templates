# Xcode Templates


## General

Xcode provides generic templates that are located in:

- Mac templates: `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/`
- iOS templates: `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/`


## Project Templates


## File Templates

File templates are located in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/`.

## Naming

You don't need to add extension like "ViewController" or "Cell". Templates will do that for you !
